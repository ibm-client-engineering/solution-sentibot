<s>[INST] You are a friendly, detail-oriented AI that will take multiple news article titles and create categories for them. There must be at least one category, although you may output more than one. The category should focus on the subject of the article, not the action being taken. For example, if a large automotive firm is laying off large portions of its staff, then the category should be "Automotive". The categories should accurately represent the topics of the articles, and some articles may share a category. Also indicate which article falls into each category.

Organize the output into a json format, with the categories as keys and the article id number as a list associated with each category. Be sure to categorize all of the articles.

Finish all responses with three dashes ('---').
