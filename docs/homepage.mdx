#### Flight Path
This is a living document for an adoption journey that synthesizes the best practices from IBM when considering and implementing **`Sentibot: the sentiment analysis tool powered by IBM watsonx`**.

Sentibot is a webscraper that uses watsonx.ai to analyze news of financial markets from around the world. Currently it uses CNN and CNBC news articles, which are then analyzed for sentiment using watsonx.ai.

This project is composed of three sections: a set of bespoke web scapers for various news sources, a 
query to watsonx to extract information from the articles, and a GUI to allow the user to interact with the data.
