#### Flight Path
This is a living document for an adoption journey that synthesizes the best practices from IBM when considering and implementing **`Sentibot: Gen-AI Powered News Scraper and Sentiment Analyzer powered by IBM watsonx`**.

Several clients are interested in expediting research by streamlining the manual process of gathering the latest information from various news sources. SentiBot is a web scraper that leverages watsonx.ai to analyze news related to financial markets worldwide. Currently, it focuses on CNN and CNBC news articles, which are then examined for sentiment using watsonx.ai. This pilot consists of three main components: a series of customized web scrapers for diverse news outlets, a query to Watson for extracting information from the articles, and a graphical user interface (GUI) for users to interact with the data. 

This project is composed of three sections: a set of bespoke web scapers for various news sources, a 
query to watsonx to extract information from the articles, and a GUI to allow the user to interact with the data.
